# Employee-Directory
An employee directory created using React JS, including filter options

## Approach
Unlike using just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, using React required me to put more consideration into the structure of my web page. I needed to consider the elements I needed, and how to compartmentalize the necessary parts such that they can be updated as necessary. Thus, my approach contained a greater focus on the design of the Employee Directory.
