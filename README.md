# Employee-Directory
An employee directory created using React JS, including filter options

## Approach
Unlike using just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, using React required me to put more consideration into the structure of my web page. I needed to consider the elements I needed, and how to compartmentalize the necessary parts such that they can be updated as necessary. Thus, my approach contained a greater focus on the design of the Employee Directory.
1. Create a list of employees using the Random User API
2. Allow the user to sort the list by changing the page's state
3. Allow the user to search the list by passing in a search as a state
